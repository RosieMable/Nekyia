# Procedurally-Generated-ZeldaGame
Nekyia
A silent adventurer leaves the comforts of his house in the middle of the night, heading towards the Ancient Ruins. Slowly, but steadily he keeps venturing deeper in old mysteries and forgotten truths.

Yet, a bigger enigma seems to linger in those dangerous rooms: why is he there?

 

 

Nekyia is a procedurally generated 2D top-down adventure game, that I have made during my second year of University to experiment with procedural generation, AI of 2D enemies and animation programming. The game is currently in a stage of prototyping and it has a fully working level generation and melee combat.

It is now online as a public alpha on itch.io to test it.

Currently the project is on hold because of University coursework, but it will be continued as soon as possible.
